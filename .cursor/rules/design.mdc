# Softa Development Principles
This project is a multi-module Spring Boot project. All final application modules to be built are located under the `apps` directory.

## Core Concepts

1.  **Follow Framework Conventions (Convention over Configuration):**
    *   Use the framework-provided base classes and utilities such as `AuditableModel`, `EntityController`, and `EntityService` to simplify development. `EntityService` encapsulates common CRUD operations for entities.
    *   Service-layer implementations should be placed under the `service/impl` package and annotated with `@Service`.

2.  **Model Definition Is Key (Model Definition is Key):**
    *   Models (Entities) are the core carriers of business logic.
    *   The `ModelManager` utility manages metadata for all business models and their fields.

3. Spring Boot Conventions

- **Component annotations**: Use standard Spring annotations to mark components, such as `@RestController`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, and `@Component`.
- **Dependency injection**: Prefer constructor injection (Constructor Injection) to manage dependencies.
- **Configuration**: Use `application.yml` for configuration management.

## Coding Practices

1.  **Leverage Framework Capabilities (Leverage Framework Capabilities):**
    *   Queries: Prefer using the framework-provided `Filters`, `FlexQuery`, and methods from the parent interface `EntityService` for data retrieval, leveraging metadata-driven query capabilities.
    *   Create/Update/Delete: Prefer calling the standard CRUD methods provided by `EntityService`. These methods delegate to the lower-level `ModelService`, which handles metadata-defined logic (e.g., default values, validation, lifecycle hooks, etc.).
    *   File handling: The `File` and `MultiFile` field types return a `FileInfo` object and a list of such objects respectively, where the objects include OSS download URLs.

2.  **Extension and Customization (Extension and Customization):**
    *   When standard functionality does not meet requirements, extend by implementing specific interfaces or overriding base class methods.
    *   Complex or non-standard business logic can be implemented in the Service layer.
    *   Avoid operating on the database directly (unless necessary); prefer using the framework APIs.

3. Development Standards
*  Introduce logging via the `@Slf4j` annotation.
*  Enum types must add the `@JsonValue` annotation for serialization.
*  Use English by default for development, including comments, log messages, and code messages.
*  For date operations, use `LocalDate` and `LocalDateTime`.

# Follow These Design Principles
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- SOLID
- KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
- YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
- Separation of Concerns
- Composition over Inheritance
- Single Source of Truth
- Loose Coupling, High Cohesion
